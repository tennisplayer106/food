  <h1 class="text">Food Wastage üçç</h1>
  <p class = "smalltext">Food wastage is related to a major world problem, climate change which is the root cause for most of the issues we humans face on our planet today. Climate change is caused by an increase concentration of greenhouse gases which prevent the heat from the sun to escape the Earth, hence warming our environment up. It has devasting impacts throughout the world and one of its largest roots grow from the problem of food wastage. Rotting food in landfills produces the dangerous greenhouse gas, Methane, which is many times stronger than carbon dioxide. Food wastage dominated 6% ‚Äì 8% of the total greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans and if we stop it, we could see a big change across the world. </p>

<h1 class="text">Facts about Food Wastage!</h1>
  <p class = "smalltext"> ‚óà According to estimates, 1.6 billion tonnes of "primary product equivalents" of food are wasted globally. For the edible portion of this, there were 1.3 billion tonnes of food wasted altogether.</p>
  <p class = "smalltext">‚óà The annual emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) equivalent to 3.3 billion tonnes of CO2 from food waste are estimated.</p>
  <p class = "smalltext">‚óà The total water used to produce food each year that is lost or wasted (250km3) is equal to the Volga River's annual flow in Russia or is three times the size of Lake Geneva.</p>
  <p class = "smalltext">‚óà In a similar vein, food that is lost or wasted is produced on 1.4 billion hectares of land annually, or 28% of the world's agricultural area.</p>
